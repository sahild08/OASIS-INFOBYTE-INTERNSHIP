          <h2>Chairman of the Tata Group</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Ratan Naval Tata</b> 28 December 1937 â€“ 
            He is an heir of the Tata family. He is the son of Naval Tata, 
            who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group.
            He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's 
            degree in architecture, and the Harvard Business School through a management course
            he completed in 1975. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. 
            He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. 
            Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, 
            in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. 
            Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60-65% of his income to charity.
